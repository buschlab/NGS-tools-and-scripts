## Here we extract the network topology from CARNIVAL's output, i.e., this is a list of 
# node pairs (Node1, Node2) connected by directed edges that have a weight attribute (Weight) as
# well as an indication for the type of relationship (Sign), i.e., activation (1) or inhibition (-1).
### Display the inferred transcription factor activity in a network.
# Parameter 'weightCut' removes edges, i.e., transcription factor activities lower than the chosen
# threshold I=[0,100].
# Parameter 'clusterSize' only allows clusters with size equal or bigger than threshold.
