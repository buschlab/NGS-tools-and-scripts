# DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS ----------------------------------------

## First we get some sample data from the 'airways' package. The inconvenient procedure
# of extracting counts and metadata just to build a new object from it - just serves to
# show how it is done. 
library("airway")
data(airway)
# extract sample information from this data set
metadata <- data.frame(colData(airway))[1:6,]
# reduce to 6 samples and order by treatment
metadata <- colData(airway) %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  dplyr::slice(1:6) %>%
  dplyr::arrange(dex)

# extract counts and bring in the same order as the samples
cnts <- assay(airway)[,rownames(metadata)]

# Check true?
all(rownames(metadata) == colnames(cnts))

# This does all the magic of initialization
# First reads in the count data from cts
# Gets the information on the smaples from "samples"
# And defines an "experimental design" along the different conditions
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = cnts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~ dex)

# Now have a look what you got                              
dds

# Next we delete all Genes that have too little counts across all samples
# We get the count matrix back and calculate the sums of every row
# if this is less than 10 (or whatever you set it), we will discard, else will keep it
keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10

# Just keep the rows from keep ;-)
dds <- dds[keep,]

# Look at dds and the dim variable? Did the number of rows change?
dds

# Now we make the statitical test - spits out some steps it performs, we can explain later 
dds <- DESeq(dds)

# Now have a look what we caluclated and which variables were defined
resultsNames(dds)

# And extract the results, but do a shrinkage of the fold change first. will explain later
# We extract exactly the result name
result <- lfcShrink(dds, coef="adjust_this_to_your_coefficient", type="apeglm")

# Order the result
result <- result[order(result$pvalue),]

# Look at the most differentially regulated genes
# The columns denote the mean expression, the fold change, the standard error of the fold change, 
# the p-value and the corrected p-value for multiple testing
head(result)

### A COMMENT ON THE DIRECTION OF DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ###
# In the previous code we see that the condition is ThyPap versus Early, 
# i.e., we calculate the difference in expression with ThyPap/Early
# That means:
# For a HIGHER expression of a particular gene in ThyPap compared to Early we obtain a POSITIVE FoldChange
# For a LOWER expression of a particular gene in ThyPap compared to Early we obtain a NEGATIVE FoldChange
# With this knowledge we take a look at the ordered results.
head(result)
#           baseMean  log2FoldChange  lfcSE     pvalue      padj
#           <numeric> <numeric>       <numeric> <numeric>   <numeric>
#   STAR    887.4095  -2.576015       0.532963  5.68891e-08 0.000183524
# Since 'STAR' has a negative FoldChange, we know that it is expressed to a lesser degree in the
# ThyPap samples --> have a look at the normalized counts
counts(dds, normalized=T)[which(rownames(counts(dds)) %in% c("STAR")),]
# We can see that the first three samples have much higher expression than the latter.

# HEATMAP -----------------------------------------------------------------
